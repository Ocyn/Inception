Imagine a VM, but inside another VM. Mindblowing isn't it?

## Introduction

Welcome to the Inception project! This repository explores the fascinating concept of running a virtual machine (VM) within another VM, pushing the boundaries of virtualization technology. 

## Concept

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create and manage virtual instances of a computer system within a host system. The Inception project takes this concept a step further by nesting VMs, creating a VM inside another VM. This can be useful for testing, development, and understanding the limits and capabilities of virtualization technologies.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- A host machine with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space)
- A virtualization software such as VirtualBox, VMware, or KVM
- Basic knowledge of virtualization and VM management

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Install Virtualization Software**: Ensure that your host machine has virtualization software installed. Examples include VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, or KVM.

2. **Create the First VM**:
   - Open your virtualization software and create a new VM.
   - Allocate resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to this VM.
   - Install an operating system on the VM. This will be our first-level VM (VM1).

3. **Enable Nested Virtualization**:
   - Ensure that the first-level VM (VM1) has nested virtualization enabled. This setting might be available under the VM's processor or CPU settings.

4. **Create the Second VM**:
   - Inside the first-level VM (VM1), open the virtualization software again.
   - Create another VM (VM2) within VM1.
   - Allocate resources to VM2 and install an operating system.

5. **Test the Setup**:
   - Boot up VM2 inside VM1 and verify that it runs smoothly.
   - Experiment with running applications and performing tasks in VM2.

### Example Use Cases

- **Development and Testing**: Developers can use nested VMs to create isolated environments for testing software across different operating systems.
- **Security Research**: Security professionals can simulate complex attack scenarios involving multiple layers of virtualization.
- **Educational Purposes**: Educators can demonstrate the principles of virtualization and nested VMs to students.

## Conclusion

The Inception project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of nested virtualization. By running a VM within another VM, we can explore new possibilities in development, testing, and research. Dive in and experience the mind-blowing world of nested VMs!
